**OrbitalOne** is a real-time 3D Earth visualization app powered by **TypeScript**, **Three.js**, and custom **GLSL shaders**. It blends beauty and function to deliver intuitive, extensible Earth-based data visualizations — including country borders, ocean overlays, live news, and more.

⚠️ Heads up: This project is in early Alpha. Some features may break, glitch, or vanish mysteriously. It's also not fully optimized or responsive yet—expect occasional chaos!

## 🌐 Vision

**OrbitalOne** is a tool for global awareness.  
It visualizes the planet’s political and environmental complexity —  
not to emphasize division, but to clarify the stakes:  
Only by seeing the whole can we navigate the parts.  
Only by embracing our smallness can we act with purpose.

## 🛰️ Philosophy

> **Orbit Alone**  
> We live on a rock, floating through a silent universe that offers no inherent meaning, no guarantees, and no rescue.  
> Borders, ideologies, histories — from space, they vanish. What’s left is one fragile system, alive by chance and sustained by collaboration.

> **Orbital One**  
> To orbit alone is to realize we are all in the same orbit.  
> One species. One biosphere. One chance to make something of it.  
> If nothing has meaning by default, then everything we choose to care for becomes meaningful — together.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frogfromlake/Orbitalone.git
cd Orbitalone/frontend
pnpm install      # or npm install
pnpm dev          # start dev server (http://localhost:5173/)
```

### Backend (Go) Setup

The backend serves country-specific news (with DeepL translation + caching) and runs separately:

```bash
cd Orbitalone/backend

# Install Go dependencies
go mod tidy

# Create a local .env file:
echo "DEEPL_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env

# Run locally
go run main.go
```

The backend also supports a lightweight admin panel (for feed management) when run in non-production mode.

## News Translation + Caching

- News is fetched via curated **country-level RSS feeds**
- Translations are powered by **DeepL** (free tier) with:
  - Language detection from ISO-3166 codes
  - Session-persistent user toggle (original vs. translated)
  - Caching layer to reduce quota usage
  - Skips translation for English-language content

Admin panel available at `/#admin` (in dev) lets you:
- View current feed mappings
- Test RSS URLs
- Add or remove feeds for any country

> All translations are cached for 24 hours using `patrickmn/go-cache`.

OrbitalOne is a quiet call to look at Earth differently.  
To zoom out — not to detach, but to care more deeply.  
Thanks for visiting 🌍
